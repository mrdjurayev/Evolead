    <h1>The Double-Edged Sword of Smart Glasses</h1>

    <p>
      The landscape of wearable technology is rapidly shifting with the rise of smart glasses, notably the
      <span class="highlight-text">Meta and Ray-Ban collaboration</span>. These devices are designed to
      function and look like ordinary eyewear while housing integrated speakers, cameras, and microphones
      intended for seamless content creation. Unlike previous iterations of tech gadgets, these are
      specifically marketed toward everyday users, making them increasingly common in public spaces.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, this technological advancement has introduced a significant privacy concern regarding
      <span class="highlight-text">covert filming without consent</span>. Investigations have revealed a
      disturbing trend on social media where creators use these glasses to record women in public locations
      such as airports and grocery stores without their knowledge. Victims have expressed feeling violated
      and "gross" after discovering their interactions were posted online to audiences reaching tens of
      millions of viewers.
    </p>

    <p>
      A common justification used by those posting such content is the claim of providing "confidence
      coaching" or social skills guidance for men. Critics and victims argue that this is merely a "cop-out,"
      as the videos often capture individuals in vulnerable states while they are cornered or simply going
      about their daily routines. This practice places an additional burden on women to be constantly vigilant
      about whether the people they interact with are secretly recording them.
    </p>

    <p>
      From a safety standpoint, while manufacturers like Meta have included a white LED light to signal when
      the camera is recording, many victims report not noticing it at all. Furthermore, tutorials have
      surfaced online teaching users how to hide or cover this light to maintain secrecy. Legally, while
      recording in public places is often protected under the First Amendment in the U.S., the ethical
      boundaries and international data protection laws remain complex areas of debate.
