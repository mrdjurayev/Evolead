    <h1>The Double-Edged Sword of Smart Glasses</h1>

    <p>
        The landscape of wearable technology is rapidly shifting with the rise of smart glasses, notably the 
        <span class="highlight-text">Meta and Ray-Ban collaboration</span>. These devices are designed to 
        function and look like ordinary eyewear while housing integrated speakers, cameras, and microphones 
        intended for seamless content creation. Unlike previous iterations of tech gadgets, these are 
        specifically marketed toward everyday users, making them increasingly common in public spaces.
    </p>

    <p>
        However, this technological advancement has introduced a significant privacy concern regarding 
        <span class="highlight-text">covert filming without consent</span>. Investigations have revealed a 
        disturbing trend on social media where creators use these glasses to record women in public locations 
        such as airports and grocery stores without their knowledge. Victims have expressed feeling 
        violated and "gross" after discovering their interactions were posted online to audiences reaching 
        tens of millions of viewers.
    </p>

    <p>
        A common justification used by those posting such content is the claim of providing "confidence coaching" 
        or social skills guidance for men. Critics and victims argue that this is merely a 
        "cop-out," as the videos often capture individuals in vulnerable states while they are cornered or 
        simply going about their daily routines. This practice places an additional burden on women 
        to be constantly vigilant about whether the people they interact with are secretly recording them.
    </p>

    <p>
        From a safety standpoint, while manufacturers like Meta have included a white LED light to signal when 
        the camera is recording, many victims report not noticing it at all. Furthermore, tutorials 
        have surfaced online teaching users how to hide or cover this light to maintain secrecy. 
        Legally, while recording in public places is often protected under the First Amendment in the U.S., 
        the ethical boundaries and international data protection laws remain complex areas of debate.
